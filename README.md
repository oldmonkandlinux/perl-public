This is a small space where I have uploaded some basic Perl scripts, which were prepared to provide basic Perl Training.
Anyone who wants to brush up their Perl knowledge can go through these programs. This is still WIP.

Here's the list of programs, and a short decription of what it does:

1. pod.pl	-> Explains PLain old Documentation(POD)
2. scalar.pl	-> Just reads a value stored in a scalar variable and prints the value out.
3. scalar1.pl   -> Same as the above program, instead of static values it asks for values from the user 
4. scalar2.pl   -> Same as the above program, adds a test to check if the age entered is not a negative value.
5. scalar3.pl   -> Asks for the firstname and second name, concatenates and prints it.
6. calc.pl      -> A small calculator program which makes use of "Switch". You might have to install the "Switch" module 
                   As, by default, "Switch" statement is not a part of Perl.
7. lottery.pl   -> A simple program to demonstrate usage of a random number function.
8. here.pl      -> Demonstrates usage of here documents.
9. next.pl      -> demonstrates next and last.
10. file1.pl	-> Reads data(numbers) from a file and adds the numbers. Uses Filehandle to open and read file.
11. file2.pl    -> Counts how many times "NetworkManager" appears in the "messages" file.
12. file3.pl    -> generates a report of local and remote ip's in the access log file.
13. file4.pl    -> Finds good hits(200) in access.log and prints the number of good hits.
14. arr1.pl     -> List elements in an array.
15. arr2.pl     -> uses GetOpt::Long, which allows the user to pass command line args.
16. arr3.pl	-> uses GetOpt::Long, which allows the user to pass command line args, and uses toggle for a force flag.
17. arr4.pl	-> reads digits from a file and prints the number of digits. Emulation of "wc -w" in linux.
18. file_wc.pl  -> reads digits from a file and prints number of lines. Emulation of "wc -l" in linux.
19. arr5.pl	-> Sort array by ascending order.
20. sub1.pl     -> A simple program demonstrating usage of a subroutine.
21. sub2.pl     -> A simple program demonstrating usage of a subroutine.
22. rpm.pl      -> check if an rpm can be installed.
23. file_find1.pl -> Finds text(.txt) files. 
24. backup.pl   -> Finds files modified the previous day and then zips those files - kind of a backup.
25. hash.pl     -> counts number of occurences uses hashes.
26. hash_count_ip.pl -> Counts number of occurences of IP in the specified file.
27. hash_stats.pl -> Sort arrays using sort function and using spaceship operator.
28. sftp.pl      -> Uses Net::SFTP::Foreign module to transfer a file (sftp).
